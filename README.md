# 06 Code Quiz

## Description
```
As a coding boot camp student
I've attempted to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
```
A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
